## Participants

User stories 
begin with "As a user ...".

Examples of different actors are:

* End-user (customer)
* End-user supervisor (who manages user access)
* End-user manager (who views exceptions and status metrics)

* Customer support
* Developers
* System Administrator (Sysadmin)
* Database Administrator (DBA)
* Network Administrator (NetAdmin)
* Site Reliability Engineer

Each of these roles have different needs:

* Different permissions to get into data (system logs)
* Different metrics
* Different sorting
* Different filtering criteria
* Different time-out settings
* Different tools to operate on data


## Personas

Personas go beyond the usual demographics:

* age
* gender
* marital status
* ethnicity
* family status

* educational attainment
* job title (profession)
* employer
* current place of residence
* location of youth

Personas are much more aligned with the 
psychographics of different groups of users.

* Liklihood to buy
* Impatience to reading, pop-ups, and delays
* Expected use of short-cuts
* Willingness to learn
* etc.

These provide a way of thinking about features to offer each group,
to evaluate the benefits of new features.

* motiviations
* expectations
