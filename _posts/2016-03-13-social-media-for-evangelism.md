## What is social media

It's not enough just to have an account with some words and pictures.

* Twitter
* Facebook
* LinkedIn

* YouTube
* Pinerest
* Instagram

* Medium
* Quora
* SlideShare

* StackOverflow

## Engagement

Measurement of engagement looks at how many took some action after reading an item.

It is rare to get more than 5% on messages delivered.

Most tweets are never read by anyone.


## Best times to tweet

Popular evangelists note that they tweet the same message <strong>several times a day</strong>
to catch the attention of people in different time zones around the world.

Services such as HootSuite
enable messages to be stored for future delivery at specific times.


## Competitive Association

When an organization makes a media splash,
competitors may hijack the hashtags being promoted
by tweeting the competitor's tag along with their own, which associates the communications together.
